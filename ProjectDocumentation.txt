Alex Peterson:


My code meets the criteria in the following ways:


1. Object oriented elements:
   1. classes : LinearRegression, BoxScore, GetData, ModelTools
   2. Subclasses: LinearRegression is a subclass of ModelTools as well as other learning algorithms that could easily be added because of this ModelTools.
   3. Abstract Class: ModelTools
   4. Interface: Learning Algorithm
2. Code elements
   1. Collection classes: used array lists as well as VariableArray and BoxScore
   2. Exception handling: Try catch statements surround code as well as threading for UI elements.
3. MVC
   1. FXMLDocumentController is always the middle man between the regression, data, etc. and the UI.
4. UI must utilize multiple scenes and one must change based on the application state.
   1. There is only one scene however it does change the plotting based on the application state.
5. “About” information is included below the spreadsheet of data.
6. Application loads a preset dataset.
